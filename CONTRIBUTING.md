# Contributing to the 2017.cssconf.eu Website

First of all: Thank you very much for your help.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.


## What Youâ€™ll Need

We try to keep the number of things you need to know in order to help as small as possible.

Our documentation generally assumes that you have already worked in web development projects and are familiar with the process of editing a website, working with git and github, installing development tools on your computer and using the command line.

If you are completely new to all this and still want to help, that is awesome as well. In that case, please get in touch with us so we can help you getting started.

With that out of the way, a technical documentation of the project and the steps required to set it up on your machine can be found in README.md in this directory.


## Finding Something To Do

Our team members coordinate the tasks that we need help with in our [Github Issue Tracker][].

When you want to start contributing, you should look at the tasks we labeled as [Starter Issues][]. Those are the tasks we considered a good way to get into the codebase and start contributing.


## The Contribution Process

All of our helpers get write access to the main repository and thus have all privileges to make changes to the live website. However, nobody should be doing changes to the website without other team members knowing about it.

To ensure this, all contributions should be done in separate branches and all changes will be reviewed before they land in the master branch. In order to start a review, you need to create a pull request with your changes.

After the review is finished, the changes are merged into the master branch, at which point they get automatically deployed to our website.


## Reporting Bugs

The right place to tell us about a bug you found is our [Github Issue Tracker][]. Please make sure to be as precise as possible and include all relevant information for us to find the problem.


## Code of Conduct

Everyone collaborating on the projects for cssconf.eu has to adhere to our [Code of Conduct][].

In the shortest possible form: Please do your best to make CSSconf EU and working on its related projects a positive experience for everyone.
