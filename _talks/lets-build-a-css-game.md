title: Let's Build a CSS Game
---

<p>Let’s live code a game together using just CSS and HTML! This talk will
demonstrate the power of CSS and will teach a few fun tips as tricks as
we build a simple game. It’ll be based in Sass — using data structures
like matrices and HTML counter-incrementing, and a little bit of web
magic to tie it all together. This talk will inspire you to play with
and create your own CSS games, pushing the boundaries of what’s
expected from the language itself.</p>
