  CSS and the hierarchy problem: What makes a CSS developer?
---

<p>This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and
systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and
developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise.
We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript
(“CSS isn’t _real_ development”), and even between CSS disciplines, but
why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male
developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that
threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a
language and as a community.</p>
