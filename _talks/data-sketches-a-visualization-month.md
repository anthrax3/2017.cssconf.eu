title: "data sketch|es: A Visualization a Month"
---

<p>
Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they werenâ€™t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun.
