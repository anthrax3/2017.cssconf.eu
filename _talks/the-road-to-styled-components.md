  The road to styled components: CSS in component-based systems
---

<p>Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus
CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are
not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building
component-based system.</p>

<p>The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently
Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component
system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right
way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated
this revolution â€“ we are now in the "Component Age".</p>

<p>
With that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIyhhHTmsXE">co-creator of css-modules</a>) sat down and started thinking about styling in this
new era. They took the best of CSS and the Web to build a new way to
style component-based systems. In this talk, Max will describe what they thought about and why they arrived where they did â€“ <ðŸ’…> styled-components.
