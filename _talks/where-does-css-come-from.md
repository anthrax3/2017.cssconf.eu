  Where does CSS come from?
---

<p>
Understanding how CSS is developed is more than an academic exercise. It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project. Then once we have new CSS on the horizon, we can all be part of encouraging browser vendors to ship it!
