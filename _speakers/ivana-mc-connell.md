  Whether in agencies, software companies, or creative studios:
  Expert-level CSS is a key skill needed to ship competitive websites,
  apps and all kinds of digital products. Long gone are the times where
  the design intern or the backend developer could take care of all
  styling needs with a few lines of basic CSS.

Developing CSS has become its own profession, with a global community,
and yup – even specialized conferences. But what exactly makes a CSS
developer? The definition of our profession is still unclear, and the
stigma of “CSS is not REAL development” remains. In her talk for
CSSconf EU, Ivana McConnell will dissect how power dynamics and
implicit hierarchies threaten to devalue the work that we do – and how
that hurts us both individually and as a community.
