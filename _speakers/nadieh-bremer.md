<p>
What do a former astronomer and a software engineer have in common? A love for data visualization! Not a joke, but a real thing: Nadieh, a data-viz designer with a background in astronomy will team up with <a href="shirley-wu.html">Shirley Wu</a>, a developer who loves painting and Pixar animation. Together they will show us how to leverage web technologies like SVG and CSS to achieve stunning visualizations, and how their collaborative project <a href="http://www.datasketch.es/">data sketches</a> helped them to explore the possibilities.
