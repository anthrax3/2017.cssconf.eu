<p>
Remember CSSconf EU 2014? Patrick introduced his work on the concept of CSS and the Critical Path, which has since become a key ingredient in every web developers toolkit. Much has happened in the world of browsers and performance, and this year, Patrick comes back to give us an update. His talk will take us on a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms, creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.
