<p>
We are so very excited to have Jessica – creator of many great open source projects like <a href="http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/">Sheetsee</a>, <a href="http://jlord.us/essential-electron">Essential Elector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron">Git-It</a> – moderate for us this year. Still, no matter how excited we are and how much we smile, we can’t seem to top Jessica herself!
