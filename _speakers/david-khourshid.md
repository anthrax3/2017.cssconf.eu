intro: >
  David Khourshid already had us speechless with his CSS animations, so we’re
  not sure what we’ll do when he gets on stage to show us how to bring that
  same fluidity and dynamism out of CodePen and into our projects.

<p>
For CSSconf EU 2017, David will be bringing a new talk about highly interactive and reactive interfaces, and how to build them. He will show not only how we can use CSS variables in cooperation with functional reactive programming to express animations, style, and layout, but how we can express them in newer and more powerful ways not previously possible in CSS, and indeed how they can be used to push the limits of styling on the Web.
