# To edit the schedule

The schedule is represented as a YAML document containing a list of slots. Each slot has a "type", "start_time", "end_time", and if the type is "talk", a "talk_id" corresponding to one of the talks in [/_talks](../_talks)

# To edit the navigation

Navigation bars are represented as YAML documents containing a list of page IDs. Page IDs are defined at the top of the page templates themselves (see [schedule.html](../schedule.html) for an example)

# Editing on GitHub

When editing through the GitHub interface, follow the instructions in the README for [Content Editing](../README.md#content-editing)
