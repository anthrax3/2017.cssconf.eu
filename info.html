    <h2 class="jump-to-anchor" id="party">Time to Party!</h2>
    <p>What would a great day be if it didn’t end in celebration! Here’s what we have planned:
    </p>
    <h3>7pm: CSSconf Dinner</h3>
    <p>Around 7pm, after the talks have ended and the big family photo has been taken, we’ll come together for food, drinks and, most importantly, to talk and discuss the events of the day with fellow CSSconf EU attendees. We’ll serve a streetfood-style dinner and snacks, including tasty vegan and vegetarian options, to keep you sated.</p>

    <h3>8:30pm: CSSconf Party</h3>
    <p>The party will take place at the conference venue, so there’ll be no long walks from dinner to drinks to party. Friends, family and the community are also welcome to join us, provided they present a party ticket at the door. Party tickets can be purchased <a href="https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconf-eu-2017" target="_blank">here</a>.<p>
