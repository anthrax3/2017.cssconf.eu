            This year, for the first time ever, we have a Festival Area!

            We do our best to ensure that the conference, venue and events throughout the day are fully accessible, so that all attendees can wholly participate in and enjoy the conference. To do this, we work closely with venue and volunteer staff prior to and on the day of the event to ensure disability access to all areas.

            As part of our <a href="/accessibility">commitment to accessibility</a>, we’re bringing real-time transcription (CART) to CSSconf EU. There will be a live feed of every word of each talk.

            We’re happy to be able to offer free, all-day childcare at the venue for children aged 3 and above. For parents with younger infants, we will provide a quiet room equipped with comfy seats, diapers and other essentials where you can retreat to throughout the day.

          <p>Berlin has two airports, both of which are located close to the city center, a 30-minute taxi ride from the venue (ca. EUR 30). There are also trains and buses that connect the airports to Berlin’s city center.</p>

          <h2 class="color--blue">Public Transport</h2>

            Berlin has many public transport options. The subway, trains, buses, trams are all operated by <a href="http://www.bvg.de/en" target="_blank">BVG</a>. We recommend getting one of the <a href="https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/group/73" target="_blank">tourist tickets</a> for the length of your stay – this will allow you to use all subway trains, trams and buses in all of Berlin, plus it comes with discounts for popular sights, museums, and other attractions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="color--blue">Bike</h2>

          <p>
            Berlin’s flat geography, its many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Berlin" target="_blank">bike lanes</a> and the <a href="http://www.yr.no/place/Germany/Berlin/Berlin/statistics.html" target="_blank">friendly weather in early May</a> make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bike+rental&find_loc=Berlin&start=0&cflt=bikerentals" target="_blank">bike rental places</a>.
          </p>

          <h2 class="color--blue">Taxi</h2>

          <p>Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the street, or use apps like <a href="https://de.mytaxi.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">MyTaxi</a> to order one.</p>
