<p class="intro">
  At CSSconf EU, we strive to bring together the most diverse group of people possible — <strong>we firmly believe in equality</strong>, which is why we invite anyone and everyone to participate. In order to make this possible, we are proud to announce our Scholarships Initiative for people who wouldn’t otherwise be able to attend.
</p>

<p>
  Our scholarships fund will support <strong>individuals from underrepresented groups</strong> to attend <a href="http://2017.cssconf.eu/">CSSconf EU</a> and/or <a href="http://2017.jsconf.eu/">JSConf EU</a>. Scholarships include a free ticket to the conference that will be awarded after an application process and lottery. Depending on the funds we can raise, we plan to also fully sponsor travel expenses and accommodation, if required.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  <strong>The deadline for scholarship applications has now expired!</strong>
  <br/>All submissions have been reviewed, and all applicants have been contacted.
