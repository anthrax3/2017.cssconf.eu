            This year CSSconf EU has moved to a new venue: <a href="http://www.arena.berlin/veranstaltungsort/arena-halle/" target="_blank">Arena Berlin</a>, a huge industrial hall with adjoining club and event spaces. The whole event, including meals and parties, will take place in here, so there won’t be any long distances interrupting your conference day.

          </h2>
          <p>
           We will reimburse your travel expenses (or even book your travel if you’d like). If your company has offered to pay: Awesome, thanks! We’d be happy to list them as a supporter on our website, so just let us know if that’s the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get reimbursed for your expenses, we ask that you email the following to <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">contact@cssconf.eu</a> and also to <a href="mailto:travel@jsconf.eu">travel@jsconf.eu</a>:

            <li>
              <p>
                An <b>invoice</b> of your travel expenses. The invoice recipient should be:<br><br>

                <li>

          <ul class="list-simple">
            <li>
              The day will start at 8:30am with breakfast and registration; talks will begin at 9:30am. You should arrive before 9:30am, so that we can set up your notebook for a test run and make sure everything works well. Find the full schedule <a href="{{ '/schedule' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a speaker or MC, you won’t have to queue at the venue for check-in, you can come to the registration desk directly. You will then get your speaker bag and your conference pass.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projector resolution is 1080p, 16:9.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can connect to the projector with VGA, HDMI or DVI. Adapters will be provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will have a WolfVision presenter for mobile devices. Please let us know in advance if you need to use this.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can connect your notebook to the stage audio. A cable will be provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              There will be power supplies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please be prepared to provide the technicians with your presentation, e.g. via USB stick.
            </li>
            <li>
              You’ll be given a headset, so you’ll have your hands free during your talk.
            </li>
            <li>
              A presentation clicker can be provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              WiFi as well as ethernet access will be available. It should be reliable, but you’re always better off having a fallback option in case the connection doesn’t work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each talk slot is 30 minutes, no Q&amp;A. We believe it’s much better to discuss things in smaller groups afterwards and you’ll have enough time and space to do that.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please arrive at the stage about 10 minutes before your talk, so you can set up properly. The MC who will introduce you will be your contact person before the talk.
            </li>
            <li>
              All talks will be professionally recorded and released after the conference. They will be publicly accessible for free, so that everyone can learn from the awesome presentations you delivered. If you wish not to have your talk recorded and published, or have any issues regarding copyright (incl. embedded images, music or similar), please let us know in advance.

            Accessibility
          </h2>
          <p>One item of frequent feedback from past years that we wanted to share with you:</p>

          <p>Attendees often have trouble reading code on the projector screens. This is true for code on slides (we understand if it is too late to change, just wanted to mention it) where it is usually best to choose the biggest possible font size that would fit on the slide all aesthetics aside – but it is even more true for code in your editor during live coding. Please take a moment to find out how to adjust font size in your favorite editor or tool such as Chrome DevTools and then switch to something in the range of 24px text.</p>

          <h3>Live Captioning</h3>

          <p>In order to provide an inclusive experience we will have live captioning during the whole conference on both tracks. Our captioning team is located remote. In order to help them to deliver the best possible quality we need your slides in advance. Please share your slides with us by Tuesday, May 2nd. Please share them via URL / e-mail attachment / Dropbox / Google-Drive.</p>

          <h3>
            Transportation
          </h3>
          <p>If you are arriving by plane, you will either get into Tegel Airport (TXL) or Schönefeld Airport (SXF). We can’t organise a pick-up service for everybody, but it is relatively easy to get into town. A cab is between 25 and 30 Euros and it is the best option.</p>
          <p>Public transit takes around 30-40 minutes to get you anywhere into Berlin (you will need an ABC ticket, single ride, for 3,40 Euro).</p>
          <p>For either option, you will want to try and get cash organised. If you take a cab, make sure to mention you want to pay by card before you get into the cab.</p>
          <p>If you are arriving by train, take public transit from the train station to your final destination.</p>
          <p>We are happy to reimburse any cab and public transit fare. We will need an invoice and the original receipts (make sure to get one from the cab) of your trip.</p>
          <p>If you need any assistance, please let us know.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            We want our community to be tolerant and welcoming, and everyone at the conference is required to agree and act according to our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. – Should you encounter or observe any form of harrassment, please let us know and we’ll take care of it!
