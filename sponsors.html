<h2 class="color--blue">From the community, for the community</h2>
<p>
  CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit conference dedicated to the creatives and engineers who build the world’s most engaging
  user interfaces. For the third year in a row, CSSconf EU will gather a diverse audience of more than 400 brilliant
  developers and designers who share a passion for the design language of the web: CSS.
</p>

<p>
  The talks focus on the latest technologies, cutting edge techniques, and tools. CSSconf creates a platform for the
  young and evolving CSS community. It bridges the gap between designers and developers and connects experienced
  professionals with new talent.

  high-quality, diverse event it is. We are always excited to discuss sponsorship and media partner opportunities,
  please reach out to <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">contact@cssconf.eu</a> for details.

<h2 class="color--blue">Why sponsor CSSconf EU?</h2>

<h3 class="color--green">International, Local, Collaborative</h3>
<p>
  CSSconf EU is one of the main events of <a href="http://wwwtf.berlin/">Web Tech Fest Berlin</a> - a week full of
  conferences, workshops, and hackathons dedicated to web development and design. Internationally, we work closely
  together with our colleagues from CSSconf in Australia, Asia, and the US.
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">Reaching Creatives in the Community…</h3>
<p>
  35k+ YouTube subscribers | 4.2k+ Twitter followers | 1k+ WWWTF attendees
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">…from 30+ Countries</h3>
<p>
  Every year, CSSconf EU is attended by people from all corners of the world: Germany, US, UK, Sweden, Australia,
  Russia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Poland, Iran, Spain, Portugal, Austria,
  Lebanon, India, Canada, Finland, Estonia, Kenya, Japan.
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">Safe, Diverse and Inclusive</h3>
<p>
  CSSconf EU holds itself up to high standards of community and diversity. Our priority is to create a welcoming and
  safe space. We strive to bring diverse voices on stage and we provide a lot of information about the application
  process, additional blog posts covering the topic, and personal support (emails, slack chat) in order to achieve this
  goal. We also reach out via email to under-represented individuals and groups to encourage them to submit talk
  proposals. An example of the success of our efforts is that in 2013 and 2014, more than 40% of our speakers were
  female.
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">Educational and Encouraging</h3>
<p>
  To achieve our goal we actively encourage new and upcoming speakers, we run <a href="http://cssclass.es/">free
  CSS workshops</a> for beginners, we collaborate with tech education initiatives, and we enforce a <a
  href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">Enabling</h3>
<p>
  We offer <a href="/diversity-support-tickets.html">Diversity Tickets</a> which enable more members
  of under-represented groups to attend CSSconf EU. Sponsors can help us with that, too – <a
  href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">ask us for ways to get involved</a>!
</p>
<h3 class="color--green">Strictly Not-for-profit</h3>
<p>
  CSSconf EU is organized by volunteers. Every cent we raise goes towards making the conference better.
